Sometimes landlord entities rent out farm land in different arrangements to different farmers. For instance, a landlord might rent out land they own as an individual to a relative, and also belong to a corporation that rents out land to other farmers. This situation applies to a small percentage of non-operator landlords, but is important to remember when looking at the counts of landlords.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>The demographic information is data about individual landlords and the principal partner in a non-operator partnership.
